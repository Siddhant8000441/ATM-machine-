# ATM-machine-
This Python ATM machine uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to manage transactions. The `ATM` class includes methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance. The `deposit` method adds funds, `withdraw` ensures sufficient balance before deducting, and  check_balance  displays the current balance, simulating a simple ATM system.
