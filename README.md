# ATM Machine

This project simulates an ATM machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The ATM system allows users to deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance, all within a simple, interactive interface.

### Features:
- **Deposit:** Add funds to the account.
- **Withdraw:** Ensure sufficient balance before deducting the requested amount.
- **Check Balance:** Display the current balance of the account.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for implementing the ATM machine.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The system is designed using OOP concepts like classes and objects for modularity and reusability.

### How It Works:
The ATM class contains:
- **Constructor (`__init__`):** Initializes the balance when the ATM object is created.
- **Methods:**
  - `deposit(amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the balance.
  - `withdraw(amount)`: Deducts the specified amount from the balance, checking if the funds are sufficient.
  - `check_balance()`: Displays the current balance.
